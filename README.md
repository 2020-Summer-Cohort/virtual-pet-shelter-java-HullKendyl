### VirtualPet Shelter

Take care of the animal residents in **The Domesticated Animal Shelter** as a new volunteer.  

To take care of the animals select one of the prompted options each turn.

Each decision you make will affect the animal residents' current needs points. In addition to the effects of your decision, 
the animals' Hunger, Thirst, & Boredom need points will decrease by five points each turn.

If you reach a status of **100** need points in any category, for any animal, you win!

If you reach a status of **0** need points in any category, for any animal, you lose.

Good luck! We hope you have fun volunteering at The Domesticated Animal Shelter.
